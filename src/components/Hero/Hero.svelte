		<h1>Germany</h1>
		<p>
			The new German government, in power since December 2021, significantly accelerates domestic
			climate policy implementation. If all measures planned in the coalition contract were
			implemented, Germany would get close to its domestic emissions target of a 65% reduction below
			1990 levels in 2030. New renewable energy expansion measures and the anticipated coal
			phase-out by 2030 may lead to Germany overachieving the sectoral target for the electricity
			sector, but other sectors lag behind.
		</p>

		<p>
			But even more measures would be necessary to overachieve the 65% target for 2030, as the
			government has promised, to make a 1.5°C compatible contribution. The government now needs to
			ensure that in all sectors the planned and new measures are effectively implemented, to
			overachieve the 2030 targets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Germany would need to reduce emissions by at least 69% domestically and give significantly
			more climate finance to other countries for it to be in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C
			limit. The Climate Action Tracker rates Germany’s current policies and targets as overall
			“Insufficient”.
